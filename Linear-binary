# 🎵 Song Search Program

# Step 1: Take playlist from user
playlist = input("Enter song names separated by commas: ").split(",")
playlist = [song.strip() for song in playlist]  # Remove extra spaces

# Step 2: Take song name to search
song_to_find = input("Enter the song to search: ").strip()

# ---------- Linear Search ----------
def linear_search(songs, target):
    for i in range(len(songs)):  # Go through each song
        if songs[i].lower() == target.lower():  # Ignore case
            return i  # Return the position
    return -1  # Song not found

# ---------- Binary Search ----------
def binary_search(songs, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(songs) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

            return mid
        elif songs[mid].lower() < target.lower():

        else:

# --- Run Linear Search ---

if pos != -1:
    print(f"\n✅ Linear Search: '{song_to_find}' found at position {pos}")

# --- Run Binary Search ---
